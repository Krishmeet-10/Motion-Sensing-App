# Motion-Sensing-App
The "Motion Sensing Android App," developed from February to March 2023 under Prof. Mukulika Maity's guidance, is designed to track and display a user's physical activity using Android devices. The app employs the accelerometer sensor for step counting through Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) algorithms, offering an estimate of the number of steps taken. Additionally, it detects whether the user is taking the stairs or an elevator, by analyzing acceleration patterns.

One standout feature of the app is its ability to map the user's trajectory on a graph. This means it records and visually represents the path the user follows during their activities. The accelerometer and magnetometer sensors are crucial components, with the former measuring motion and step count and the latter contributing to accurate trajectory mapping. Overall, this app serves as a valuable tool for users interested in monitoring their physical activity and mobility patterns. It can have applications in fitness tracking, healthcare, and mobility analysis with further development possiblities.
